I have started reworking to my two sites that I started in early 2022. I learned the Jekyll static website builder and rewritten the whole website using Jekyll. This website and the wiki of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' was build page by page copy pasting same code every time I had to make another page. This was a painful experience and was actually regressive.  

With Jekyll I don't have to write the same code again and again, and its quite productive as well. I have rebuilt this site in no time retaining the same theme that was being used before. Some new features added in the website is a blog and the design is responsive.  

I am currently working on the other website which is very difficult task because it has many pages. Every character has its own page and a lots of info. Before Jekyll making this site was a nightmare, but now I can use some of the cool features of Jekyll to pace things up. Really hoping to complete the site soon. Wish me luck.
