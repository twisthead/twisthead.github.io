But I have to write something, can’t leave the page blank for long, the worm inside of me won’t let me be at peace until I fill this page. I was born in a small town in eastern UP, called Deoria. Been interested in literature since childhood, also in computers since teenage. I joined Aligarh Muslim University to study literature (a wholesome decision to be honest!).\n\nI want to have a career related to books, literature, reading, writing and all because I think I can do things like this with more ease and enjoy doing it. Since my family has a tradition of choosing the teaching as a profession like my grandfather, father and lots of other people in my family. So, I don’t mind having teaching as a career. But  I would obviously prefer academia more because it involves critical thinking and research skills, which I have recently been more attracted to.\n\nMore on my interests\nHere’s my CV\n\n\nAbout This site\nThis site is build by me as a personal space of my own on the internet.

Detachment is a very sad movie and I can’t imagine anyone doing it better than Adrien Brody did. Detachment is aobut loneliness and pain and how every individual has their unique way of dealing with it.\n\nBrody plays a character named Henry Barthes, he is a school teacher of English and the movie shows Henry reflections in the events that unfold in the timeline of the film.\n\nMany times we find people suffering and all we can do is to comfort them to face their challenges on their own. Mr Barthes tries to do that in this movie and meanwhile it helps some people and fails at saving some. It is not a absolute solution to the problem but it encourages individuals to look at the problem in the face.\n\nAt the same time contrary to its very title, the film shows instances of attachment between the characters. It is a ironic situations but I think it represents that in the most bizzare cases of detachment, like the case of Mr Barthes who is detached from the joys of daily life, can find attachment in unsuspecting beings.\n\nThe film has layers and I haven’t fully understood it yet, I think it will take several more watches to fully get whatever is going on with detachment.\n"

    "title": "Meal Ticket from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs",
    "url": "/pages/literary_banters/mealticket.html",
    "content": "Meal Ticket from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\n\n\n\nI was watching a movie called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, I had previously seen several scenes of this movie on YouTube. Those were some selected iconic scenes from the movie. And those were really, really good that’s what compelled me to watch the movie in the first place.\n\nSo, the movie is directed by the Coen brothers, it is set in the wild west. The movie is different because it is not a single story throughout a movie, rather it is a collection of six vignettes. The vignettes were usual stories from the west where shootings, hangings, robberies were going on until I reached the third vignette which was quite different from the first two and even the upcoming ones. This really did catch my eye and slipped under my skin and stayed with me for several times. It was hard to let go.\n\nI’ll quickly write the summary here, and then I’ll move on with my analysis.\n\nThe third vignette starts with a man driving his cart into a small town, once there the man puts up an announcement of some sorts saying that some performance is going to be organised that night. At night, the man converts his cart into a makeshift stage, when the curtains are lifted we see a man with no hands and legs on a chair. The man is a performer, and he recites literary piece from Shelley, Shakespeare, Biblical stories and Abraham Lincoln’s speech. He is quite impressive and there are good number of audience enjoying the show. He ends his performance with impactful lines, and the man who drives the cart collects money from the audience.\n\nThe sequence goes on, the performer and the impresario travel to various towns and perform however, as they move to smaller towns, people show less enthusiasm for such literature and dramatic monologues. Time comes when there are only two or three audiences and they also do not give any money. The impresario sees a mob of people watching a chicken solving a simple addition, subtraction calculation by tapping on the numbers. People are enthusiastically take part in this and also pay the chicken man for the chicken to solve their calculations.\n\n\n\nThe Impresario buys the chicken from the man, thinking that he could earn a lot more with the chicken than the performer. The performer is sad seeing the chicken. They begin their travel to some other town, on the way the impresario crosses a river and an idea strikes his mind. He throws a rock in the river to judge the depth of the river and then comes smiling at the performer who is sitting in the wagon.\n\nThe throwing of the performer is not shown in the scene, but the viewers can guess what happens next. This was the most powerful story of all the stories, and it really struck me hard. It left me with some dwindling thoughts that continued to linger with for some days. Being a student of literature, it was very relatable to me, considering that the value of poems and literature per se is fading gradually. People prefer visual form of entertainment more and generally have less time to invest in reading text, which is unto itself is a demanding task.\n\nWe the students of literature are getting as irrelevant and devoid of any real value as the performer became at the end of the story. The show did not get any money to the impresario, so he decided to change his trade and bought a chicken which was more relevant to the general masses than a dramatic performance of world classics. In that exact manner, we are losing our relevance in a world which has no time to read books and learn something by reading a book. There is abundant information and entertainment available at the tips of the fingers, then who’d take the pains to go through word by word and page by page.\n\nLiterature and literary studies by extension is gradually being drowned in a river and the world is slowly adapting to the chicken which though it is popular has no real value or is far from being ideal or helpful in the long run. Time will come when the literature will be thrown completely in the river and the world would not care. It would continue to go on as always.\n"

    "content": "Opinions\nOn Contemporary Novels\nI think most of the contemporary novels are garbage and reading them is merely wasting one's time. Except one or two talented writers most of the others are not worth reading. I don't know about general masses but as a student of critical humanities, I would never suggest someone to read them. \nOne can read them to pass time but then don't label yourself as reader/booklover/kitabikeeda in your insta bio.\n\nOn Reader’s Block\n\nThere’s a popular term known as ‘writer’s block’ which refers to a period when writers find themselves unable to write anything. This is quite a promient problem among writers. However, there is a similar problem with readers also where they want to read works but the right time just does not come. I am not aware of any such term existing for the readers but if there is please let me know.\n\nSo, I think that this term should also be popularised and discussed more oftenly in reader groups to tackle and address this issue. However, much of ‘reader’s block’ comes from not putting effort in reading, unlike writing reading requires much less of our faculties. In my honest opinion, if someone is facing reader’s block they should just sit down and finish some chapters.\n\nHowever, apart from these hasty generalisations, I think this requires more rigorous analysis looking for causes of this effect on readers. I am sure smartphones and popular culture will come out as culprits.\n"

There was a time when I spend a good amount of my time listening to his speeches and reading about him. His views on revolution, race, discrimination, countering people and argumentation helped me understand quite a bit. He is also one of reasons why I have interest in postcolonial and subaltern subjects.\nEdward Said\n\n\n  \n  Edward Said is a theorist and humanities professor. His ground breaking work 'Orientalism' outlines the production of knowledge regarding the orient (the east) by the westerners. 'Orientalism' became the base of budgeoning field of enquiry called postcolonialism, which enquires the reasons and effects of colonisation. Said's work has inspired me a great deal and basically shaped my understanding of humanities as such and its scope. I suggest everyone regardless of their field should study 'Orientalism'. Said is also a Palestinian Christian, he has written a book called 'The Question of Palestine' which talks about the Palestine and ideas rgarding its history and its illegal occupation by Israel.\n\n"

Henry\nThis is very simple story yet very moving, it makes us wonder how much we care about people around us and to what extent can one go for them. I think O. Henry is one of the greatest writers of short story along with Guy de Maupassant, Saki etc.\n\n### The Man to Send Rain Clouds\nI read this short story by Leslie Marmon Silko the American Literature course I took in my MA. It is about a man who is trying to save his culture however he could. This short piece is really powerful and when reflecting on the story relating to the historical background it narrates, it really makes sense what must the families of native Americans have gone through. I don't want to giver spoilers here. You can find more after reading the story, it short but poignant and potent.\n\n### Bernard Malamud\nHis short story _\"The First Seven Years\"_ was part of my syllabus in my undergraduate program. It is a very touching story about a diligent man and his perseverance. I have reread the story several times and every time it gives me a fresh insight on the virtues of perseverance and purity of soul. To be someone with a pure soul and a warm heart is true peace of life. You can read the short story here. **[The First Seven Years](https://loa-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/static/pdf/Malamud_Seven_Years.pdf)** [PDF]\n"

And one things that did the most was to watch movies. It was at that time that I watched _Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind_.\n\nThe movies features Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. The movie is categorized as science fiction but I see more as a romantic drama type. You can read more about this movie or watch it to know what happens in the movie. I'm going to express what this movie taught me.\n\nI've watched this movie multiple times as it doesn't come to you in full in a single watch. There are a lot in the movie to have a grasp on. It is fundamentally different from other romantic movies out there. It was released in 2004 when the technology was quite new.\n\nThe movie make the viewers aware that there can be ugly truth in each other but that doesn't mean that one should abandon one another. As in the movie the characters try to erase each other from one anothers memory which is an attempt to escape the torments of past experiences and to move on.\n\nThe poignancy of the movie comes out when we see the character of Jim Carrey fighting to save bit and pieces of his memory when the Doctors try to erase memories pertaining to his former girlfriend Tangerine.\n\nI think it is a must watch movie for anyone who wants to understand the intricacies of human relationship. \n"

  "title": "Experiences While Making a CV Website",
  "url": "/2024/01/05/cv.html",
  "content": "So, recently I have taken to creating multiple websites, which include a daily journal which is heavily a work in progress and the second one is my CV. Creating a single-page CV website was not a challenging task unto itself, but making it through an SSG was kind of a bump in a road. You see, writing vanilla HTML is boring and repetitive, by using an SSG we can automate the repeating code and just write the main content. Since, I am learning to work with Jekyll, so I thought I’d give it a try.\n\nWhen I started writing, I started by manually writing all the information, my details and everything, but just then I though wait, I can automate this as well. I thought of a thing called ‘data files’. Using ‘data files’ you can store data in a separate file and then render those data in the HTML. By this you need not write code every time you enter some new detail, rather you just enter the specific data in the data files, and it will be automatically generated for you.\n\nFor example, let’s say my CV has a section which lists all the internships I’ve done till date, so I entered the list in the code like this\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt;Internship 1 &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;details:&lt;/strong&gt;details regarding the internship &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;details:&lt;/strong&gt;more details \n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nBut after using ‘data files’ I can write as little as just.\n\n- Name: 'Internship 1'\n  details: details of the internship\n  details: more details\n\nNow while these benefits exist, another pros is even important which is the readability of the document, I mean if I write a long HTML document it is going to be a disaster if I need to make some changes in the future. For simplicity’s sake, using ‘data files’ was the best way to go. In Jekyll, I made a ‘YAML’ file and put all my details there, and then wrote code in the index.html to render the data in the webpage. So, now with as little code as possible and without repeating the same code, I can display all my details.\n\nAnother thing I did was, instead of writing my own CSS to style the webpage, I turned my head towards the CSS frameworks. The CSS frameworks are basically pre-written code (which are fashionably called boilerplate code) which you can use in your website without having to write all the same code yourself. The frameworks are a great way of saving time, because why waste time writing some code which has already been written by numerous people.\n\nAfter several hours of work, I finally managed to create a website which looks good and is minimal. However, I am still thinking about changing font and several minor improvements, otherwise the website is ready.\n\nHere, you can have a look - CV\n"

  "url": "/2023/12/09/adding-pagination-in-jekyll-site.html",
  "content": "Recently I was thinking of adding pagination to my site, and it turned out to be a nighmare.  I had to google so many things and waste so much time. After spending considerable amount of time researching, I got it working finally.\n\nThe pagination in Jekyll is difficult and it is incomprehensively documented on Jekyll Docs, which makes it pretty difficult to add pagination to the site. Here I am aiming to sum up numerous tutorials which helped me add pagination to my site.\n\nFollow along and do exactly what’s stated and you’ll have the pagination.\n\n1. Install required gems\n\nYou need to install the plugin \"jekyll-pagination\".\n\nEdit “config.yml” &amp; “gemfile” file\n\nAdd the follwing lines in ‘config.yml’\n\nplugins:\n    - jekyll-paginate\n\npaginate: 5\npaginate-path: \"/blog/page:num/\"\n\nIt should look something like this\n\n\n  \n\n\nAdd the following line to “gemfile” located in the root directory.\n\n# place it just below the line \"group :jekyll_plugins do\"\n\ngem \"jekyll-paginate\"\n\nIt should look something like this.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Open a terminal, navigate to your directory and run the command.\n\n\n# run in terminal\n\nbundle install\n\nNow you are done with half of the work.\n\n2. Making a page where you list your blogs.\n\n\n  Make a folder called “blog” in project’s root directory.\n  Inside the folder make a file called “index.html”.\n\n\n3. Put the below code to generate list of posts with pagination.\n\n---\nlayout: default\ntitle: My Blog\n---\n\n&lt;!-- This loops through the paginated posts --&gt;\n{% for post in paginator.posts %}\n  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ post.url }}\"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"author\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"date\"&gt;{{ post.date }}&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n    {{ post.content }}\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n\n&lt;!-- Pagination links --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"pagination\"&gt;\n  {% if paginator.previous_page %}\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ paginator.previous_page_path }}\" class=\"previous\"&gt;\n      Previous\n    &lt;/a&gt;\n  {% else %}\n    &lt;span class=\"previous\"&gt;Previous&lt;/span&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n  &lt;span class=\"page_number \"&gt;\n    Page: {{ paginator.page }} of {{ paginator.total_pages }}\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  {% if paginator.next_page %}\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ paginator.next_page_path }}\" class=\"next\"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;\n  {% else %}\n    &lt;span class=\"next \"&gt;Next&lt;/span&gt;\n  {% endif %}\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nNow you have your paginated post.\n\n\n  Not successfull?\n    \n      Make sure there’s no typo in any of the  entries.\n      Make sure you executed every command.\n      Comment your issue.\n    \n  \n\n"

  "title": "How Web Apps can actually help grow Linux",
  "url": "/2023/11/03/how-desktop-apps-can-help-linux.html",
  "content": "I am a very passionate Linux user, and I appreciate the philosophy that works behind the “Free Software” and “Open Source Initiative”. Linux in the computing world acts as an equivalent to the opposition parties in a democracy. In a democracy, an opposition party is needed to keep the ruling party in check. Just like in the computing world, the ruling party is the big tech companies that enjoy a large market share of their products. Linux (or any alternative OS to Windows and macOS such as FreeBSD, Haiku, etc.) keeps checking on the operating systems that have a larger market share. Users always have the option to move away from the operating system they are currently using if they are not satisfied with the services. Linux provides that option. However, many users can’t make the change because of the unavailability of software and apps for Linux. A lot of software developers do not make their software compatible with Linux because the market share is comparatively lower than that of mainstream operating systems.\n\nThe thesis argument of this blog is that “how could the web apps help popularise and make easy the move to Linux for the users?” As we move closer to making the web capable of doing almost all things natively on PCs, More and more software companies are providing web apps for their software, like Adobe Photoshop, which does not have a Linux version of their software. So, the user can actually use the web version of Photoshop on Linux as it can on Windows or macOS. Linux supports browsers and performs natively with web apps, and in many cases, it performs way better than Windows. With the growing popularity of web apps, it is going to be immensely easy for those users who hesitate to migrate because the software they work on does not support Linux.\n\nThis is an excellent thing for Linux as well, not because it can garner more profit from the increase in users. Rather, it will be good because more people will come to know how good the Linux operating system is, regardless of the myth that it is only for tech enthusiasts.\n"

  "url": "/2023/08/08/newblog.html",
  "content": "I have started reworking to my two sites that I started in early 2022. I learned the Jekyll static website builder and rewritten the whole website using Jekyll.  This website and the wiki of ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ was build page by page copy pasting same code every time I had to make another page. This was a painful experience and was actually regressive.\n\nWith Jekyll I don’t have to write the same code again and again, and its quite productive as well. I have rebuilt this site in no time retaining the same theme that was being used before. Some new features added in the website is a blog and the design is responsive.\n\nI am currently working on the other website which is very difficult task because it has many pages. Every character has its own page and a lots of info. Before Jekyll making this site was a nightmare, but now I can use some of the cool features of Jekyll to pace things up. Really hoping to complete the site soon. Wish me luck.\n"

  "url": "/2023/08/04/rewriting-the-website.html",
  "content": "I am rewriting this whole website in the new website builder called Jekyll. This is a new experience and I am learning a lot. This approach of building websites is totally different from how I previously build websites. In this way I don’t have to copy or write repetitive code again and again rather ‘Jekyll’ applies the same code to all pages with the same layout. This saves a whole lot of time.\n\nA lot of work has to be done in the website to make it look complete, however a website is never complete. Anyway, developing is very fun because, firstly I am learning something new doing it, secondly I am getting a chance to revamp my site for more functionality. I am looking forward to integrating a lot of other things in this website which I hope be even more interesting. I also hope you will enjoy your time being on my site because a lot of content is going to be added in the nooks and corner of this site to find by the visitors.\n\nI hope you enjoy.\n\ntake care. adios.\n"
