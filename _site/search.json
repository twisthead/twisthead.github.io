But I have to write something, can’t leave the page blank for long, the worm inside of me won’t let me be at peace until I fill this page. I was born in a small town in eastern UP, called Deoria. Been interested in literature since childhood, also in computers since teenage. I joined Aligarh Muslim University to study literature (a wholesome decision to be honest!).\n\nI want to have a career related to books, literature, reading, writing and all because I think I can do things like this with more ease and enjoy doing it. Since my family has a tradition of choosing the teaching as a profession like my grandfather, father and lots of other people in my family. So, I don’t mind having teaching as a career. But  I would obviously prefer academia more because it involves critical thinking and research skills, which I have recently been more attracted to.\n\nMore on my interests\nHere’s my CV\n\n\nAbout This site\nThis site is build by me as a personal space of my own on the internet. There is not a lot going on; on this site but I like to tinker things around here sometimes.\nThe website is hosted by GitHub, here is the Repo Link.\n"

    "title": "Meal Ticket from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs",
    "url": "/pages/literary_banters/mealticket.html",
    "content": "Meal Ticket from The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\n\n\n\nI was watching a movie called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, I had previously seen several scenes of this movie on YouTube. Those were some selected iconic scenes from the movie. And those were really, really good that’s what compelled me to watch the movie in the first place.\n\nSo, the movie is directed by the Coen brothers, it is set in the wild west. The movie is different because it is not a single story throughout a movie, rather it is a collection of six vignettes. The vignettes were usual stories from the west where shootings, hangings, robberies were going on until I reached the third vignette which was quite different from the first two and even the upcoming ones. This really did catch my eye and slipped under my skin and stayed with me for several times. It was hard to let go.\n\nI’ll quickly write the summary here, and then I’ll move on with my analysis.\n\nThe third vignette starts with a man driving his cart into a small town, once there the man puts up an announcement of some sorts saying that some performance is going to be organised that night. At night, the man converts his cart into a makeshift stage, when the curtains are lifted we see a man with no hands and legs on a chair. The man is a performer, and he recites literary piece from Shelley, Shakespeare, Biblical stories and Abraham Lincoln’s speech. He is quite impressive and there are good number of audience enjoying the show. He ends his performance with impactful lines, and the man who drives the cart collects money from the audience.\n\nThe sequence goes on, the performer and the impresario travel to various towns and perform however, as they move to smaller towns, people show less enthusiasm for such literature and dramatic monologues. Time comes when there are only two or three audiences and they also do not give any money. The impresario sees a mob of people watching a chicken solving a simple addition, subtraction calculation by tapping on the numbers. People are enthusiastically take part in this and also pay the chicken man for the chicken to solve their calculations.\n\n\n\nThe Impresario buys the chicken from the man, thinking that he could earn a lot more with the chicken than the performer. The performer is sad seeing the chicken. They begin their travel to some other town, on the way the impresario crosses a river and an idea strikes his mind. He throws a rock in the river to judge the depth of the river and then comes smiling at the performer who is sitting in the wagon.\n\nThe throwing of the performer is not shown in the scene, but the viewers can guess what happens next. This was the most powerful story of all the stories, and it really struck me hard. It left me with some dwindling thoughts that continued to linger with for some days. Being a student of literature, it was very relatable to me, considering that the value of poems and literature per se is fading gradually. People prefer visual form of entertainment more and generally have less time to invest in reading text, which is unto itself is a demanding task.\n\nWe the students of literature are getting as irrelevant and devoid of any real value as the performer became at the end of the story. The show did not get any money to the impresario, so he decided to change his trade and bought a chicken which was more relevant to the general masses than a dramatic performance of world classics. In that exact manner, we are losing our relevance in a world which has no time to read books and learn something by reading a book. There is abundant information and entertainment available at the tips of the fingers, then who’d take the pains to go through word by word and page by page.\n\nLiterature and literary studies by extension is gradually being drowned in a river and the world is slowly adapting to the chicken which though it is popular has no real value or is far from being ideal or helpful in the long run. Time will come when the literature will be thrown completely in the river and the world would not care. It would continue to go on as always.\n"

    "content": "Opinions\nOn Contemporary Novels\nI think most of the contemporary novels are garbage and reading them is merely wasting one's time. Except one or two talented writers most of the others are not worth reading. I don't know about general masses but as a student of critical humanities, I would never suggest someone to read them. \nOne can read them to pass time but then don't label yourself as reader/booklover/kitabikeeda in your insta bio.\n\nOn Reader’s Block\n\nThere’s a popular term known as ‘writer’s block’ which refers to a period when writers find themselves unable to write anything. This is quite a promient problem among writers. However, there is a similar problem with readers also where they want to read works but the right time just does not come. I am not aware of any such term existing for the readers but if there is please let me know.\n\nSo, I think that this term should also be popularised and discussed more oftenly in reader groups to tackle and address this issue. However, much of ‘reader’s block’ comes from not putting effort in reading, unlike writing reading requires much less of our faculties. In my honest opinion, if someone is facing reader’s block they should just sit down and finish some chapters.\n\nHowever, apart from these hasty generalisations, I think this requires more rigorous analysis looking for causes of this effect on readers. I am sure smartphones and popular culture will come out as culprits.\n"

There was a time when I spend a good amount of my time listening to his speeches and reading about him. His views on revolution, race, discrimination, countering people and argumentation helped me understand quite a bit. He is also one of reasons why I have interest in postcolonial and subaltern subjects.\nEdward Said\n\n\n  \n  Edward Said is a theorist and humanities professor. His ground breaking work 'Orientalism' outlines the production of knowledge regarding the orient (the east) by the westerners. 'Orientalism' became the base of budgeoning field of enquiry called postcolonialism, which enquires the reasons and effects of colonisation. Said's work has inspired me a great deal and basically shaped my understanding of humanities as such and its scope. I suggest everyone regardless of their field should study 'Orientalism'. Said is also a Palestinian Christian, he has written a book called 'The Question of Palestine' which talks about the Palestine and ideas rgarding its history and its illegal occupation by Israel.\n\n"

I have my favs as well. \n\n  Macbeth\n\n  Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\n  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,\n  To the last syllable of recorded time;\n  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n  The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,\n  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,\n  And then is heard no more. It is a tale\n  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n  Signifying nothing.\n\n\n\nJulius Caesar, spoken by Marc Antony\n  \n  Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;\n  I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\n  The evil that men do lives after them;\n  The good is oft interred with their bones;\n  So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\n  Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:\n  If it were so, it was a grievous fault,\n  And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.\n  Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–\n  For Brutus is an honourable man;\n  So are they all, all honourable men–\n  Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.\n  He was my friend, faithful and just to me:\n  But Brutus says he was ambitious;\n  And Brutus is an honourable man.\n  He hath brought many captives home to Rome\n  Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\n  Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?\n  When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:\n  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:\n  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;\n  And Brutus is an honourable man.\n  You all did see that on the Lupercal\n  I thrice presented him a kingly crown,\n  Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?\n  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;\n  And, sure, he is an honourable man.\n  I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\n  But here I am to speak what I do know.\n  You all did love him once, not without cause:\n  What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?\n  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,\n  And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;\n  My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\n  And I must pause till it come back to me.\n  \n  \n\n  Henry VI Part III (ACT 3, Scene 2)\n  \n  I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,\n  And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,\n  Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head\n  Be round impaled with a glorious crown.\n  And yet I know not how to get the crown,\n  For many lives stand between me and home:\n  And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,\n  That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,\n  Seeking a way and straying from the way;\n  Not knowing how to find the open air,\n  But toiling desperately to find it out,--\n  Torment myself to catch the English crown:\n  And from that torment I will free myself,\n  Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.\n  Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,\n  And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,\n  And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,\n  And frame my face to all occasions.\n  I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;\n  I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;\n  I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,\n  Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,\n  And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.\n  I can add colours to the chameleon,\n  Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,\n  And set the murderous Machiavel to school.\n  Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?\n  Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.\n  \n\n\n\n  Richard III (Act 1, Scene 1)\n  \n  Now is the winter of our discontent\n  Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\n  And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house\n  In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\n  Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\n  Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\n  Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\n  Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\n  Grim-visaged war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;\n  And now, instead of mounting barded steeds\n  To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\n  He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber\n  To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\n  But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\n  Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\n  I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty\n  To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\n  I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,\n  Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\n  Deformed, unfinish’d, sent before my time\n  Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,\n  And that so lamely and unfashionable\n  That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\n  Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\n  Have no delight to pass away the time,\n  Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\n  And descant on mine own deformity:\n  And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\n  To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\n  I am determined to prove a villain\n  And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\n  Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\n  By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\n  To set my brother Clarence and the king\n  In deadly hate the one against the other:\n  And if King Edward be as true and just\n  As I am subtle, false and treacherous,\n  This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,\n  About a prophecy, which says that ‘G’\n  Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.\n  Dive, thoughts, down to my soul:\n  \n\n\n"

Henry\nThis is very simple story yet very moving, it makes us wonder how much we care about people around us and to what extent can one go for them. I think O. Henry is one of the greatest writers of short story along with Guy de Maupassant, Saki etc.\n\n### The Man to Send Rain Clouds\nI read this short story by Leslie Marmon Silko the American Literature course I took in my MA. It is about a man who is trying to save his culture however he could. This short piece is really powerful and when reflecting on the story relating to the historical background it narrates, it really makes sense what must the families of native Americans have gone through. I don't want to giver spoilers here. You can find more after reading the story, it short but poignant and potent.\n\n### Bernard Malamud\nHis short story _\"The First Seven Years\"_ was part of my syllabus in my undergraduate program. It is a very touching story about a diligent man and his perseverance. I have reread the story several times and every time it gives me a fresh insight on the virtues of perseverance and purity of soul. To be someone with a pure soul and a warm heart is true peace of life. You can read the short story here. **[The First Seven Years](https://loa-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/static/pdf/Malamud_Seven_Years.pdf)** [PDF]\n"

And one things that did the most was to watch movies. It was at that time that I watched _Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind_.\n\nThe movies features Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. The movie is categorized as science fiction but I see more as a romantic drama type. You can read more about this movie or watch it to know what happens in the movie. I'm going to express what this movie taught me.\n\nI've watched this movie multiple times as it doesn't come to you in full in a single watch. There are a lot in the movie to have a grasp on. It is fundamentally different from other romantic movies out there. It was released in 2004 when the technology was quite new.\n\nThe movie make the viewers aware that there can be ugly truth in each other but that doesn't mean that one should abandon one another. As in the movie the characters try to erase each other from one anothers memory which is an attempt to escape the torments of past experiences and to move on.\n\nThe poignancy of the movie comes out when we see the character of Jim Carrey fighting to save bit and pieces of his memory when the Doctors try to erase memories pertaining to his former girlfriend Tangerine.\n\nI think it is a must watch movie for anyone who wants to understand the intricacies of human relationship. \n"
