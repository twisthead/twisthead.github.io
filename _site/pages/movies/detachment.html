<p>Adrien Brody is one of my favourite actors, he has so much truthfulness on his face when he acts its truly amazing. Detachment is a very sad movie and I can’t imagine anyone doing it better than Adrien Brody did. Detachment is aobut loneliness and pain and how every individual has their unique way of dealing with it.</p>

<p>Brody plays a character named Henry Barthes, he is a school teacher of English and the movie shows Henry reflections in the events that unfold in the timeline of the film.</p>

<p>Many times we find people suffering and all we can do is to comfort them to face their challenges on their own. Mr Barthes tries to do that in this movie and meanwhile it helps some people and fails at saving some. It is not a absolute solution to the problem but it encourages individuals to look at the problem in the face.</p>

<p>At the same time contrary to its very title, the film shows instances of attachment between the characters. It is a ironic situations but I think it represents that in the most bizzare cases of detachment, like the case of Mr Barthes who is detached from the joys of daily life, can find attachment in unsuspecting beings.</p>

<p>The film has layers and I haven’t fully understood it yet, I think it will take several more watches to fully get whatever is going on with detachment.</p>
