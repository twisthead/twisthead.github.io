<h3>On Contemporary Novels</h3>
<p>I think most of the contemporary novels are garbage and reading them is merely wasting one's time. Except one or two talented writers most of the others are not worth reading. I don't know about general masses but as a student of critical humanities, I would never suggest someone to read them. <br>
One can read them to pass time but then don't label yourself as reader/booklover/kitabikeeda in your insta bio.</p>
