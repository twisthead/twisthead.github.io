This is my personal website. I play with the website in order to make it better. No a professional web designer.
The website features some of the random work I do online. [Check it here](https://twisthead.github.io/)
### About the site
- The site is build using Jekyll. 
- I have used custom theme for this site. CSS and layouts are made from scratch
