<div class="post-heading">A few changes to the website</div>
<p class="date">08 August 2023 &bull; Nazm Us Saqib</p>
<section><p>I have started reworking to my two sites that I started in early 2022. I learned the Jekyll static website builder and rewritten the whole website using Jekyll. <!--more--> This website and the wiki of ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ was build page by page copy pasting same code every time I had to make another page. This was a painful experience and was actually regressive.</p>

<p>With Jekyll I don’t have to write the same code again and again, and its quite productive as well. I have rebuilt this site in no time retaining the same theme that was being used before. Some new features added in the website is a blog and the design is responsive.</p>

<p>I am currently working on the other website which is very difficult task because it has many pages. Every character has its own page and a lots of info. Before Jekyll making this site was a nightmare, but now I can use some of the cool features of Jekyll to pace things up. Really hoping to complete the site soon. Wish me luck.</p>
