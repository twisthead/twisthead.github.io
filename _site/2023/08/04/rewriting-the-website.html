<h1>Complete rewriting the website</h1>
<section><p>I am rewriting this whole website in the new website builder called jekyll. This is a new experience and I am learning a lot. <!-- more --> This approach of building websites is totally different from how I previously build websites. In this way I don’t have to copy or write repetitive code again and again rather ‘jekyll’ applies the same code to all pages with the same layout. This saves a whole lot of time.<br />
A lot of work has to be done in the website to make it look complete, however a website is never complete. Anyways, developin is very fun because, firstly I am learning something new doing it, secondly I am getting a chance to revamp my site for more functionality. I am looking forward to integrating a lot of other things in this website which I hope be evem more interesting. I also hope you will enjoy your time being on my site becuse a lot of content is going to be added in the nooks and corner of this site to find by the visitors.<br />
I hope you enjoy.<br />
take care. adios.</p>
