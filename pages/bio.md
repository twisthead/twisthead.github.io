When I think about what I should write in the bio section, my mind goes blank. But I have to write something, can't leave the page blank for long, the worm inside of me won't let me be at peace until I fill this page. I was born in a small town in eastern UP, called Deoria. Been interested in literature since childhood, also in computers since teenage. I joined Aligarh Muslim University to study literature (a wholesome decision to be honest!).

I want to have a career related to books, literature, reading, writing and all because I think I can do things like this with more ease and enjoy doing it. Since my family has a tradition of choosing the teaching as a profession like my grandfather, father and lots of other people in my family. So, I don't mind having teaching as a career. But  I would obviously prefer academia more because it involves critical thinking and research skills, which I have recently been more attracted to.
