When I think what should I write in bio section my mind goes blank. But I have to write something, can't leave the page blank for long, the worm inside of me won't let me be at peace until I fill this page. I was born in a small town in eastern UP, called Deoria. Been interested in literature since childhood, also in computers since teenage. I joined Aligarh Muslim University to study literature (a wholesome decision to be honest!).

I want to have a career related to books, literature, reading, writing and all. I think I can do thinks like this with more ease and enjoy doing it. I come from a family of teachers, my grandfather, father and lots of other people in my family are teachers so, I don't mind having teaching as a career, no sir, not at all. :P
