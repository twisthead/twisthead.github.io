### Wiki for One Hundred Years of Solitude
When I read 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', it inspired me very much. When I looked online there wasn't any good wiki for this novel like they have on fandom for comics and all. So, my interest in html joined hands with my idea of creating a wiki. The website is currently running [here](https://wiki-ohys.github.io/).  

### My CV

Made a single page website which is basically my CV. Was just doing for fun, learned some cool things about data files in Jekyll. Have a look [here](https://twisthead.github.io/curriculum-vitae/).
