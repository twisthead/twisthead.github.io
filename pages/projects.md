### dePaywall - Extension to remove paywall
---
This is a Firefox extention I made which removes paywall from any page with a single click. [Install Here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/depaywall/)

### Wiki for One Hundred Years of Solitude
---
When I read 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', it inspired me very much. When I looked online there wasn't any good wiki for this novel like they have on fandom for comics and all. So, my interest in html joined hands with my idea of creating a wiki. The website is currently running [here](https://wiki-ohys.github.io/).  

### My CV
---
Made a single-page website which is basically my CV. Was just doing for fun, learned some cool things about data files in Jekyll. Have a look [here](https://twisthead.github.io/curriculum-vitae/).

### My Daily Journal
---
Since I like writing a lot and I love to make wepages as well, so I though maybe I should collaborate with me and make a website where I would post my daily journals if I could. So, I made one. [Check Out](https://twisthead.github.io/daily-journal/)
