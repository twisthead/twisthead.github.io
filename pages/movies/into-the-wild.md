This is one film that has influenced me a lot and untangled a lot of messed up threads in my mind. The film is shot beautifully if we talk about the aesthetics, music and scenes. Meanwhile, the content and storyline is equally moving, I watched it in the lockdown, and it had a profound impact on me as a person.
