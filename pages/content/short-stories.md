### The Man to Send Rain Clouds
I read this short story by Leslie Marmon Silko the American Literature course I took in my MA. It is about a man who is trying to save his culture however he could. This short piece is really powerfull and when reflecting on the story relating to the historical background it narrates, it really makes sense what must the families of native americans have gone through. I don't want to giver spoilers here. You can find more after reading the story, it short but poignant and potent.
