_In this section I will discussing something about movies. Commentaries, critical analysis, opinions and rants._

- I think people should watch marginal movies more, because that's where the truth resides. Everybody watches mainstream movies but that's a facade and there is hardly anything that the viewer is going to get out of it. Go for regional, marginal, less-talked-about movies.
