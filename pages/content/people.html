Malcolm X is one of my greatest inspiration. There was a time when I spend a good amount of my time listening to his speeches and reading about him. His views on revolution, race, discrimination, countering people and argumentation helped me understand quite a bit. He is also one of reasons why I have interest in postcolonial and subaltern subjects.</p>
<h2>Edward Said</h2>

  Edward Said is a theorist and humanities professor. His ground breaking work 'Orientalism' outlines the production of knowledge regarding the orient (the east) by the westerners. 'Orientalism' became the base of budgeoning field of enquiry called postcolonialism, which enquires the reasons and effects of colonisation. Said's work has inspired me a great deal and basically shaped my understanding of humanities as such and its scope. I suggest everyone regardless of their field should study 'Orientalism'. Said is also a Palestinian Christian, he has written a book called 'The Question of Palestine' which talks about the Palestine and ideas rgarding its history and its illegal occupation by Israel.
