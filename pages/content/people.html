Malcolm X is one of my greatest inspiration. There was a time when I spend a good amount of my time listening to his speeches and reading about him. His views on revolution, race, discrimination, countering people and argumentation helped me understand quite a bit. He is also one of reasons why I have interest in postcolonial and subaltern subjects.</p>
